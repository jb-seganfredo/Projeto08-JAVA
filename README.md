# Activity 8 - Exercise List - Practicing Programming Logic in Java

This repository contains solutions for Activity 8 for the Full Stack (React + Java) program, a list of exercises focused on programming logic using the Java language. These programs cover fundamental programming concepts, such as mathematical operations, string manipulation, and control structures.

The proposed exercises were:

### 1. Simple Calculator
Write a program that:
- Requests two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
- Performs the indicated operation.
- Displays the result.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
Create a program that:
- Reads a word and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- Ignores case differences.

### 3. Fibonacci Sequence
Implement a program that:
- Prompts the user for the number `n`.
- Calculates and displays the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

### 4. Reversed Number
Create a program that:
- Reads an integer.
- Displays the reversed number.
- Example: Input `1234` -> Output `4321`.

### 5. Anagram Checker
Write a program that:
- Receives two words.
- Determines if they are anagrams (contain the same letters in a different order).
- Example: "amor" and "roma" are anagrams.

### 6. Guessing Game
Create a program that:
- Chooses a number between 1 and 50.
- Allows the user to guess the number.
- Informs whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
- The game ends when the number is guessed.

### 7. Word Counter
Write a program that:
- Reads a sentence provided by the user.
- Counts and displays the number of words in the sentence.
- Considers that words are separated by spaces.
